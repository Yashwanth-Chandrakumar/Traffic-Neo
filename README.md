# Traffic Neo - Smart Traffic Optimization Algorithm

**Traffic Neo** is a Python-based smart traffic optimization algorithm designed to prioritize emergency vehicles (such as ambulances) while ensuring fast traffic flow across up to 4 lanes. Built with efficiency and scalability in mind, Traffic Neo uses CCTV cameras to monitor traffic conditions and adjusts traffic lights dynamically, ensuring smooth traffic management in urban areas. The algorithm is resource-efficient, making it suitable for real-time implementation in cities.

## Features

- **Priority for Emergency Vehicles**: Automatically detects emergency vehicles (ambulances) and provides them with priority to pass through intersections.
- **Up to 4 Lanes**: Designed to handle traffic flow across intersections with up to 4 lanes, ensuring adaptability to various city layouts.
- **CCTV Camera Integration**: Uses live feeds from CCTV cameras to monitor real-time traffic conditions and adjust traffic light timings dynamically.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Optimized for speed and resource efficiency, allowing real-time processing and quick response times.
- **Resource-Efficient**: Designed to work with limited resources, ensuring low computational overhead while maintaining high performance.
- **Real-Time Traffic Control**: Continuously monitors and adapts traffic lights based on traffic flow and emergency vehicle presence.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV (for CCTV camera integration), NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (for development and demonstration)

## Installation

To get started with **Traffic Neo**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-neo.git
cd traffic-neo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed, and then install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### 3. Set Up CCTV Camera Feed (Simulation)

This algorithm is designed to work with real-time CCTV feeds. You can simulate the feed with a video file or a live webcam.

```python
# Example to use a webcam feed:
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change 0 to the video file path if using a simulation
```

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook

After setting up the environment, run the Jupyter notebook for testing the algorithm:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook in your browser and run the cells to see the smart traffic optimization algorithm in action.

## Algorithm Overview

### 1. **Emergency Vehicle Detection**
Traffic Neo integrates a real-time detection mechanism using CCTV feeds to detect emergency vehicles. The system looks for vehicles with flashing lights (usually ambulances, fire trucks, etc.) using image processing techniques.

### 2. **Dynamic Traffic Light Control**
Once an emergency vehicle is detected, the system gives priority to that vehicle, adjusting traffic light timings in real time. It ensures the vehicle can pass through the intersection with minimal delay, without significantly affecting the flow of regular traffic.

### 3. **Lane Management**
The algorithm handles up to 4 lanes at each intersection, dynamically adjusting the green and red light timings to balance the flow of traffic across all lanes. It ensures that no lane is congested and adjusts based on traffic density.

### 4. **Resource-Efficient Traffic Management**
To minimize resource consumption, the algorithm uses lightweight image processing techniques to detect emergency vehicles and optimize traffic lights. It runs efficiently on a standard CPU, making it suitable for cities with limited computational resources.

### 5. **Real-Time Adjustment**
The algorithm continuously monitors traffic flow and adjusts the timings of traffic lights based on the latest CCTV feed. It also logs traffic conditions for analysis and improvement.

## Usage

1. **Load the Traffic Simulation**:
   Run the Jupyter Notebook and load your CCTV feed (or a simulated video file). The system will automatically start detecting traffic conditions and emergency vehicles.

2. **Observe Traffic Light Adjustments**:
   Watch as the system adjusts traffic light timings in real time, providing priority to emergency vehicles while maintaining overall traffic flow.

3. **Customization**:
   Modify the traffic light timing rules, lane configurations, and emergency vehicle detection parameters to adapt the system to different city setups.
